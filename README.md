## Installation

###Using CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like PREBorderView in your projects.

####Podfile

```ruby
pod 'PREBorderView', "~> 3.1"
```

###Manual

Otherwise just include `UIView+PREBorderView.{h,m}` in your project.

## Usage

Adding a line to a view

```objective-c
UIView* view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
[view addBorderWithColor:[UIColor blackColor] andWidth:2 atPosition:PREBorderPositionRight];
```

Remove a line

```objective-c
[view removeBorderAtPosition:PREBorderPositionRight];
```

For convenience of usage you are able to specify a `defaultBorderColor` as well as 

- `addRetinaPixelBorderWithColor:atPosition:` which adds a line of with a width of one display pixel (retina pixel)
- `addRetinaPixelBorderAtPosition:` adds the line useing the `defaultBorderColor`
- ...

To easily update all borders to size changes of views use 
  - Use `layoutBorders` to update borders of a view.
  - Use `layoutSubviewBorders` to update borders of a view, as well as all borders of subviews.
  
To update a controller's view to auto layout changes call `layoutSubviewBorders` in `viewDidLayoutSubviews`.
